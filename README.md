# MicroPython SPI & I2C Display Driver for SSD1306 monochrome OLED
The library supports drawing lines, shapes, text, sprites and images.  All code is documented and there are demo examples.

Sample XGLCD fonts are included in the fonts folder.  Additional fonts can generated from TTF fonts using a free utility called MikroElektronika [GLCD Font Creator](https://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator).

There are sample images in monoHMSB format.  Iâ€™ve included a python app in the utils folder to convert images in common formats such as JPEG and PNG to monoHMSB.
